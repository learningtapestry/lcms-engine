          <p>We unite educators from across the nation for multi-day, intensive, transformative learning experiences designed to build, improve, and sustain instructional excellence in their particular grade. Our Standards Institutes offer three pathways: an ELA pathway divided by grade bands focused on curriculum, planning, and instruction; a math pathway divided by grade levels focused on the same; and a leadership pathway aligned to both ELA and math with a focus on systems, structures, curriculum, and instructional support.</p>
