      <p>If there’s not sufficient time to deliver the lesson in one 60 minute sitting, the lesson can be broken up as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introducing the Read-Aloud up to—but not including—Purpose for Listening (~10-15 minutes)</li>
        <li>Purpose for Listening, Presenting the Read-Aloud, and Discussing the Read-Aloud (~25-30 minutes)</li>
        <li>Work Time (~20 minutes)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Pacing guidance is not applicable when lesson adaptations are made</p>

      <p>Introducing the Read-Aloud and Work Time may have activity options that exceed the time allocated for a 60 minute lesson. For a 60 minute lesson, you will need to make conscious choices about which activities to include based on the needs of your students.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Teacher can do a minimally scaffolded version of the lesson and then the students who need support get specific skill work using text from the lesson in a later class period (that teacher would pull out the activities for scaffolding that were not done from the ELA class)</li>
        <li>The teacher can do the lesson over a period of two days (45 minute classes) using all of the embedded scaffolds</li>
        <li>The teacher can do the lesson in one day (90 minute class)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Pacing guidance is not applicable when lesson adaptations are made</p>

      <p>This lesson is paced for a 45-minute time period. Teacher may reference adaptation guidance at the unit-level page to make pacing adjustment based on needs for scaffolding student reading, writing, listening, and speaking in order to meet the grade-level standards.</p>
