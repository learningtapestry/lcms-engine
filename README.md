# LCMS Engine
Implements a Rails engine for Learning Content Management System (LCMS) applications.

Our initial goal is gathering the common code among the current LCMS implementations
(Odell, Unbound ED and OpenSciEd) and provide a unified codebase that can be mantained and developed
separately, simplifying the client applications in the process.

## Requirements
- Ruby 2.3 or higher
- Rails 4.2 or higher
- Postgres 9.6 or higher

## Installation
Include the gem in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lcms-engine'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install lcms-engine
```

## License
